        <p id="intro">Abstract: <b>The book Brunelleschi’s Dome is by Ross King </b> who writes about one of the first Renaissance geniuses of the time, who improves and reinvents architecture. 
            With responsibility, innovation and art the architect-in-chief or Filippo Brunelleschi was able to convince the people of Florence that a Dome weighing thirty-seven tons could withstand the test of time. However, Filippo would have been unable to build such a Dome if he had not visited the Roman ruins and developed his own reputation as an artist, architect and inventor. Even the Black Death, the threat of War and the criticisms could not deter Filippo from his Dome; it survives now as a wonder and forever will because of Filippo’s genius. The amazing part about the Dome is the how it was constructed and how many people of Florence risked their lives by trusting Filippo’s design. Once the Dome was completed, it forever changed the way people thought of architecture, astronomy and the Renaissance genius Filippo Brunelleschi.</p>

        <p><b>Conclusion: </b> Filippo will always be remembered as a Renaissance genius because of his inventions and innovations in architecture that had an impact that reached far beyond his century. His genius also lay in his ability to galvanize support and his ability to learn and apply the wisdom waiting to be discovered in the ruins of ancient Roman civilization. Through his experiences in Rome, he was able to overcome the skepticism of the “Opera del Duomo.” With Filippo’s own self-determination and the help of Donatello and Toscanelli, who were geniuses in their own right, Filippo was able to build a Dome that is truly one of the great wonders of the world, even today.</p>
